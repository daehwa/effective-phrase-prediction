If you enjoy service by someone who is as competent as he is personable
I would recommend Corey Kaplan highly
The time he has spent here has been very productive and working with him educational and enjoyable
I hope not to need him again (though this is highly unlikely) but knowing he is there if I do is very nice
By the way
I'm not from El Centro

After being on the phone with Verizon Wireless trying to figure out why my phone wasn't working for 4
5 hours
I was put in touch with Sharpie Tech
Well
after 10 seconds they fixed the problem
As the owner of a company that does our best numbers over the holiday season
having my phone out of order for 4
5 hours was horrible
Sharpie Tech fixed the problem in record time
even Verizon was shocked
I highly recommend working with this company and I look forward to working with them more

Works fast and very effiecient with his time
Going to use him again real soon to do additional IT services
thanks Corey
Highly recommended
Went in yesterday looking for a dresser to use as a tv stand
Found the perfect piece for the retro look I'm going for
I found some other small decor items
Price was fair and they delivered today
Shawn did a great job
Keep up the good work! I will definitely be back
I walked in here looking for a specific piece of furniture
I didn't find it
but what I did find were so many things that I didn't even know I needed!  So much cool stuff here
go check it out!What a great place! Modern on Melrose has amazing furniture at great prices
I highly recommend and will be back when I am looking for new pieces
A hidden gem! Found a beautiful buffet for a great price
Whether you're looking for new or something to refurbish
this place is def worth the look!This place is a great for those vintage/mid century modern finds
From clothing to couches they have it all and great prices too
They have similar items to their neighbors Modern Manor
but not the "designer" prices
We got a green vintage chair for $98 and just are having the skirt around the bottom removed to show the great legs on it
We will always check back at Melrose when looking for unique pieces for our home
This is the place to go for all your Mid Century finds
We live in Oro Valley and it is not too far to travel when we need a specific item
I called yesterday asking if they has something we need and minutes later I was text numerous pictures
Because of the excellent staff
I will be going up there today
One of my number one places to go when I go to Phoenix
Prices are very fair for these past treasures
Great items at a good price
Helpful
easy to deal with owners
Just the sort of place you LIKE spending  your dollars at
and they have furniture
etc
that you don't see elsewhere
Disappointing
I've been there twice hoping that a re-return would change my original opinion
The first time I was there was on a Saturday
early afternoon in Spring
I found it strange that I was the only one in the store for about 20 minutes
until another customer came in
Melrose is usually a pretty happening place during the Spring before summer temps hit
I saw a lot of nice 1960s furniture
mostly living room sets and home decor
Prices were on the high end for
let's face it folks
used furniture
The blonde lady who came out to greet me after I made it to their second room (there are 3 rooms total) was frazzled and preoccupied with eating her lunch
So I went back again last week
Didn't see the frazzled lady from before but a mid-age hipster guy at the counter who didn't have the time to greet me (sorry I disrupted your cell phone surfing)
Yep
I was the ONLY person in the store and you obviously ignored me
It's just an unwelcoming place
So much potential
but the attitude there is less than acceptable
Will spend my $$$ elsewhere
I'm a local Real Estate agent and have fallen in love with all of the AMAZZZZZING Mid-Century Modern properties that the Phoenix and Tempe area have to offer
After listing and selling a few of these COOL homes I decided that I should be more familiar with a few MCM furniture shops that I could buy or lease a higher quality furniture
After going in a bunch of places I can say that I really love this store and cant wait to use them to stage my newest listing in a few months at 24th and Indian School
Let me know if you need help finding a cool house with character to put your amazing finds from Modern on Melrose
Enjoy

comModern on Melrose is one of our favorite shops on La Curva
It is on the pricey side (of an already pricey shopping experience) but I've had great success for two reasons:
First
the service has been excellent and friendly
We're new to the mcm scene and didn't get snubbed at for not being "in the know" -- sadly
this was a welcome relief
Second
the selection is good
Yeah
it's always a hunt
but at MOM you aren't going to be sifting through
basically
garbage to find your treasures
With most of the weeding done for you
the store is a much nicer visit
Walked into the store and stuck up a conversation with Shawn behind the counter
We talked about some furniture and other ideas I had for the home
I told him I needed a custom made shelf
Shawn asked some questions and then he sketched out a concept
I loved it
He then said Modern on Melrose has a man that does custom metal work
Three days later-it was done and it turned out better than I could have ever imagined
What a lovely place
My boyfriend and I went along with my parents (who love mid century modern furniture) just to look as I am moving soon and can't buy any furniture until I relocate
but this shop made me want to move to downtown Phoenix and fill my house with everything in this shop
My thrift-genius parents taught me to buy antique furniture and never ever ever buy new
as new furniture is expensive to buy and cheaply made
Modern on Melrose is fantastic proof of this - my boyfriend fell in love with a yellow leather and wood 70s couch and noticed that this beautiful couch cost less than a couch our friend recently bought at IKEA
And no one is going to buy IKEA couches in antique stores 40 years from now
because they barely last 1 move
Everything in this store is gorgeous and there is a great variety of furniture and random decor goods
We ended up buying some great stacking canisters as a gift
and the very helpful employee dashed back to the area we got them and told us they were 40% off
We debated keeping the canisters because they were as affordable as they were quirky and useful and interestingly designed
but the Christmas spirit prevailed and we decided to give them to their original recipient
The same employee discussed style and furniture things with my father in a very helpful and absolutely non pretentious way
which is a refreshing and fun element of any antique store
I always want to talk to the employees but very often feel they are too busy or want to sound smarter than me (which they are
but I'm not buying anything if the person I'm giving money to makes me feel stupid)
I was very struck by how open and helpful the employee was
Great experience
Great selection
Great prices
Unfortunately
Yelp does not allow negative stars
I was very much looking forward to going to Modern on Melrose as my sister had raved about the selection and several purchases she recently made here
I was all set to help her select more furniture for her new home until I experienced a combination of disbelief
shock and horror
I was inside the store when I heard a man loudly say "If you're going to start a sale
finish it!" It took a few more seconds of loud voices before I realized an argument was taking place between two employees and not two customers
as I initially thought
The male and female employee continued to loudly argue
back and forth
Feeling very uncomfortable
I started to look for my sister
There were about four other customers and we all ended up outside as we all felt very uncomfortable in the store
As I was walking out of the store to go out back
I heard the male employee say
in a tone that was beyond anger but instead violent
"Don't you ever tell me to shut up! Ever!" Shortly after
he walked past all 5 female customers
who had gathered out back
turned to us and angrily said "Bitch!" Not knowing what he was going to do when he returned
we decided to leave as we did not feel safe
It is one thing to feel uncomfortable
it is completely unacceptable to not feel safe
The interaction between the two employees was the most unprofessional thing I have ever witnessed
The male and female employee were so caught up in their own negative interaction
neither of them offered any customer service
And after their argument ended
the female employee offered no apologies and still no customer service
Today was my first and last time in Modern on Melrose
How terribly sad for this store
I sincerely hope the owners get a handle on this and educate their employees as to what it and isn't acceptable behavior
Favorite vintage store I have been in
I have been going to a lot lately looking for midcentury furniture that won't empty out my bank account
Happened to drive by this place and decided to take a look
I got a 3 piece coffee table and side tables set for 60 bucks
Can't beat that
The lady working I completely loved! She was helpful and let me know what kind of stuff will be coming in
This will be a weekly stop for me
If you are looking for awesome vintage furniture in good shape this is the place to go
They know their stuff
A lot of awesome lamps and boomerang coffee tables
It is a must visit
update: seems like items are getting higher and higher
style has changed a bit
still nice stuff if you wanna empty your bank account
no longer a weekly stop but i will still  stop by
I stumbled upon Modern on Melrose earlier in the week in my search for bedroom furniture
I had been a a few other shops but nothing caught my eye
When I walked in I knew immediately that I was in the right place
The store is very well curated unlike many other vintage/antique shops
I spent a few minutes looking around (I don't like to be bothered right away when I come in to a store)
Cynthia greeted me warmly and I asked her to help me pick out some bedroom furniture
She asked me about my style preferences and showed me around
She noted what I liked and didn't like and made informed recommendations
It took me all of ten minutes to pick out the furniture I wanted
Cynthia actually asked me if I wanted to take some time to consider my purchase (not pushy at all!) and I told her I loved everything and I wanted to take delivery as soon as possible
I then asked Cynthia to help me find a pair of lamps for the bed side tables I purchased
This time around I wasn't really loving anything but she took the time again to show me around and listen to my input
Another reviewer mentioned that their pieces are pricy and that could not be further from the truth
I had found some lower end shops that did not have the quality I was looking for and I also found some very high end shops
Modern on Melrose has excellent prices and the quality to back it up
I was pleasantly surprised by the value they provide
I was able to have my furniture delivered the next day and I'm loving my new (old) furniture
I highly recommend you check them out!Overall
I'll never go back
Rewinding to the reason of my conclusion: messy racks
bad choice on jewelry
no focus on fits whatsoever
no pricing consistency
and paint-scraping help from the hired help (owner of Red)
I felt like I was bothering someone instead of shopping
I recommend Retro Ranch
Fashion by Robert Black
France's or the new Vintage shop next to Hula's and Lola Coffee on Central Ave
I love Mint
and even though I'm a guy and there isn't much for me there
it's a great place for gifts for the lucky gals in my life
It's definitely worth checking out
despite what the other reviewers have said so far
I read the reviewer before me and checked things out for myself
I don't know about the size 0-4 comment because I found 3 dresses all over size 8 and some great necklaces all very reasonably priced
Rumor has it the day to go is Sunday or Monday
which is when more things are added to the inventory
I also left my name and email because I was looking for a vintage Chanel bag and I got an email when they got one
I can't afford to shop on the furniture side of the store but I've found a lot of great funky things at mint
Hmmm
what to say about Mint
Okay
if you are a girl and looking for clothes here
I'd say pass
Unless of course you have a tiny waste and are maybe a size 0-4 on a good day
If you are looking for funky earrings
it might be worth a stop
but the majority of their earring inventory was kinda weird and a little too 80's inspired for my retro taste
If you are looking for stellar quality (and priced accordingly) funky retro furniture
then definitely pop in here as their selection is really cool and there were a ton of pieces that I easily would have purchased
As for the rest
I'd say hit this store up every once in again and see what they have to offer and if they start carrying bigger sizes in dresses
lemme know :)I like this Vintage/New shop
I think they need to do something about getting new (vintage) items in more frequently there are things still there from visiting almost a year ago
Overall I have bought some great finds there and will most definately go back
I remember really enjoying browsing through Mint (and their furniture friends Red) before
I love mid-century Modern (but what casually reading Dwell but highlighting Ikea pseudo-art bitch DOESN'T?) 
I like interesting jewelry
I think the space is really intense
like I am in a dream of some sort
But I went recently
and I just didn't like it
Sure
these are collectible pieces
goregous condition
the space is well cared for
I don't expect to afford these museum worthy pieces
especially at 11grand for a chair and ottoman (oh god
I hope the ottoman was included in that price
)
but the affordable pieces of bracelets
earrings
clothing
um
it was a lot of the same items I saw here over a year ago
actually more like TWO years ago
so
the inventory isn't very turnovering or fresh
so I guess Mint isn't so fresh?
Overall
I was underwhelmed
I didn't feel particularly welcomed either time I was here
and the stock continues to center on polyster 70s clothing and BCBG tops (?) making an uneven style feel and chilly ambiance
Definitely not worth a stop
The vintage 1930 beaded earrings are still calling to me
I can hear them
Knowing I saw similar ones being sold for $15 at Cost Plus vs the $60 for the vintage ones helps a little - but not much
Very cute vintage accessories and clothing
I almost teared up seeing a super cool crinoline like the one I had in high school
(Yea
sometimes I was that girl
We're moving on
)  Really great stuff
A bit high priced
but not when you consider it's quality
Everything they had was great
It didn't feel like estate sale shopping
ya know?
Then there's the other 1/2 of the store that is an art gallery
Somehow it just works
Here the prices were extremely reasonable
Some really great stuff too
It's behind much of the Roosevelt Row stops
just a bit behind Holgas
Cool
yet approachable
Well
Well
well
Ive been highly recomended to check this place out
now that I had a chance to see what the hype was all about
I can see for myself that they had very cool pieces of funiture and retroesque clothes
Very impressed up until I asked for some help and questions
and thats were the place lost its apeal
I was quickly imformed that they delt with very high end resorts and hotels
and as for myself adding these pieces in my store would not be a good idea
I think coming in would be a great experiece for someone to see bad service at its finest
Red's merchandise is amazing
Mint's left a little to be desired
ok alot to be desired
Alright
cranky service be damned (now this is a store within a store
it is all the same service for both
it is  just that Red's merchandise is so untouchable (literally even! "do not sit" signs abound) that you almost feel like you deserve the treatment because your lusting after
yet can not afford their wares)
I have ventored into this spot appx twice a year since it has opened
Why am I still starring at the same clothing? I know my sticky fingers have not picked up a frock I could not live without but then I figured it was because I am  both cheap and picky
A hard to please combo
Seriously though
I have been starring at the same stuff for years now
Boring
I have been consistently underwhelmed by this place since I moved to the hood a year ago
With so many great vintage spots and local boutiques so close why should anyone make the stop at this over priced and under-friendly place? Your lucky if you get so much as a "Hi!" here
The vintage clothes are so so and I have been looking at some of the same ones for over a year now
Go to the 7th avenue shops if you want a fun and friendly vintage experience
I highly doubt anyone uses Yelp to find a place like this
but figured I'd write them a review because WSP rocks!
Anyone in the Phoenix area with a need for any type of specialty fuel
look no further
Personally I use them to purchase methanol for a water/meth injection kit I have in my car
and their prices are literally the lowest I've seen in the country for methanol
Paid $3
49/gal today
In addition to methanol
they sell every type of fuel
oil
lubricant you can imagine
Race fuel
AvGas
E85
etc
And different from lots of other industrial-type places
everyone that works here is incredibly helpful and nice
This place is great!  I first came here to fuel up my old Mercedes on B99
Even though I live in East Mesa
I would attempt to get there as often as possible
as they are the only place in the valley that will pump B99
The staff is always friendly and helpful
The only complaint I have is that their hours make it difficult for me to get fuel
I understand this
however
as most of their business is from bulk specialty fuel sales
not B99 fill ups
In response to Sara U
you really have nothing to worry about for getting 5 gallons of E85
Your car is already running on 5-10% ethanol every time you fill up with unleaded
I wouldn't do it on a regular basis
but it is not like you put diesel in a gas vehicle or vise versa
 Just fill up with regular unleaded
then have somebody clear your check engine light for you
It will probably throw a code about the O2 sensor
not because it is broken
but because the oxygen content of the E85 is higher
It shouldn't come back on
And no
I don't work there
I'm just a scientist who knows a thing or two about fuel!Dave S can kiss my heini 
I called them to ask if they fuel up regular unleaded gas before going down there and they said yes
They need to inform their customers correctly and label their tanks in addition so it's obvious what they are actually putting into your vehicle
By the way Dave
they put UNLEADED REGULAR fuel (not biofuel) in my tank to dilute the E85 (duh) after they realized they made the mistake
My service engine light has now come on thanks to these idiots
You obviously work there Dave
Get your facts right
This place is a area staple! Been around for years and not much has changed - I see this as a good thing! Stable and reliable!
My family goes every year for St
Pattys Day corn beef! Very nice place for a bar night dinner
or to catch up with some friends over drinks!Got my mojo back after having a few of their appetite teasers
Love LPW for a no-frills bite to eat
Don't go here for the decor
but the staff is friendly and the fried pickles are very tasty
Good value
I believe in awarding stars bearing in mind the type of restaurant reviewed
One can tell by the name that LPW won't replace Ohio's lost Maisonette restaurant in Cincy any time soon
nor does it aspire to do so
but for a sports-bar type venue
these folks do it all right
and do so at the right price!
Stopped for lunch on a Saturday
The lady got a cheeseburger and fries
I got scrod and broccoli
we split an order of their fried pickles as an app
The pickles were dill spears coated with just the right amount of what was likely a beer batter and deep fried to tangy perfection
They got the spears vs
chips decision right!
The lady usually looks askew at this type of fare
but happily camped out over the plate and ate her fair share! 
And here's the kicker they were under four bucks! 
Kudos Mr
Pickle; you done good!
The fries were very lightly battered and done perfectly
with just the right amount of crispness outside followed by a creamy interior
the fry guy here knows his craft!
And the burger was good as well
typical of the genre
I find it difficult to fawn excessively over  a burger
The scrod was a very generous sized portion
nicely caramelized and served with lemon and butter and perfectly done
When I was given the option of fries or baked potato or rice I asked if there were a green option and broccoli was offered
it was done perfectly as well and the amount was easily enough for two to share
My dinner came with a salad
which happily WAS NOT from a bag-o-lettuce
but rather freshly cut romaine
a cuke slice or two
carrot shreds and tomato
and it was accompanied by a store bought dinner roll and butter
The service was quite good
although the waitress appeared to be a bit over-extended
but that's a management issue
not the server's fault
Happily they are in the Cleveland Entertainment book
and as I had the coupon sitting on the table during the meal
the waitress took the value off of the ticket before it was even presented!
I'm all for efficiency
especially when it affects how quickly I can get out of a restaurant
That move garnered the fifth star!
We both stated that we will go back in a heartbeat!If you like fried food and laid back
then this is the place for you
Nothing that will blow your mind
but the people are great
the restaurant is laid back and casual and the food
while not very creative
is cooked well
presented well and the prices are not ridiculous
THE CLASSIC BURGER IS AMAZING
It's definitely a top ten burger
The fries are good too
I was not impressed with how gross this place is - I wasn't sure I wanted to order anything
The food was not outstanding
I think I would go across the street to the Tavern!!Okay bar food
Nice bar setting but food is average
service is average and in general doesn't really art itself apart in anything
Would I go there again? Probably if I'm in the area
Would I go out of my way to go there or make note of it to others? Probably not vegetable soup was good though and wings were fairly priced
Was boozin and cruisin with my canine comrade
Went all the way out to Hudson via Brecksville/82
Looking for anything to Yelp
Nothing
Not even in the strip mall I used to hit in Hudson on my dry cleaning route back in the day
There was a deli
but it opened at fucking 11! Who even wants to go to a deli after 11? Weak
Breezed through Peninsula
Winking Lizard? Bah
Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend
London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup
Incidentally
investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood
Live and learn
Cozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians
plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch)
Like the Unicorn
food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew
I could get used to this kind of service
The bar was all old men
Matt
I don't know how you do it
They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit
I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass
How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices
at fast food speed
served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges
Busted open the styro box
Big sandwich with mushrooms
onions
cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um
I never ate those as a kid
but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES
He didn't want it
so we threw it all around the room
Fries were awesome
Also got a pickle
That's eight dollars with the beer
just to recap
Great value
nice location
old men
I won't wait four more years to come back
Alright
i was about to give it 3 stars bc it's not that great
but it's super cheap
wait
but it's kinda filthy too
so umm
3
final answer
The food is edible
but a bum could afford to eat here
so i mean
it sure beats eating out of a dumpster
Cheap brews
cheaper food
I think the building is made out of iron
my phone practically turns off whenever I go inside
Okay
so it is a bar with an old fashioned family restaurant attached
We were there almost 2 hours for the Tuesday night burger special
They need more staff
The table was a little sticky
However
the food was delicious
The French fries were nice and crispy
and the Half pound burger didn't taste like a pre-made frozen patty
Our total bill was $15
30 for 2 meals and 2 Cokes
We'll definitely go back
3 stars is fair for this pub
The food is good and well priced for a bar
Tuesday has $5 burgers and chicken sandwiches
The pecan pie is good for dessert
I got the chicken dinner
it came with a 6 oz chicken
broccoli
steamed potatoes
salad
and roll
It was ok
I'd stick with the burgers though
The salad was fresh
Their fries are really good
Unmmmm
no
It's a bar with tables in the next room
It's feels grungy
Service was good
food
not so much
Praying I don't get sick!
Everything tasted like it came from a can! Nothing fresh or tasty about it
Guess who won't be back?Have dined in twice now and today was take out for corned beef sandwich
I don't know why I keep thinking this place is going to change
Food is at best "ok"
The inside is a dive needs some serious updating
This would be ok if this place was a hidden dive bar with amazing food- not the case
Today's lunch- puke
Dry corned beef
probably the worst I ever have had
Lession learned never returning
This place is very dark and dingy on the inside
It is the cliche of townie bar
The food was just okay but the drinks were super cheap and the service was good
This small tavern
has great burgers and the best fries within 100 miles!  It's simple
unpretentious
and the folks are mellow and ready to accommodate their customers
I understand they added music on the weekend and will surely check it out on the weekend
The food is typical
Wait how much was my meal
Then that food is awesome!  Very friendly atmosphere
Prompt service
Diner/Bar type place with no particular theme
(Sorry if there is an attempted theme
I didn't see it
)  Not a foodie spot or hidden gem
but something about this place just feels
nice
Side note: My apologies for my complete unintentional dine and dash
Wrong card
Also sorry to the other guest whose bill I signed for them
There'a a reason that everyone loves this place; it's your typical neighborhood bar in the evening (it's typically middle-aged locals
not a rowdy crowd) but it's also a great place to grab a nice meal with your family during the day
They also have a fish fry every Friday during Lent
The food is really good for bar food
and it's very reasonably priced
Obviously
this is not five star fine dining
but if you're looking for a cheap and inviting place to hang out with friends and family
this is a great place
and the food is great for what it is
Not particularly good
Bathroom is nasty
Food decent
Terrible cell phone signal and no WiFi
Probably won't return
Went here last Friday for dinner very disappointed!  Waited for ever for someone to tell us to seat ourselves and then waited forever for the waitress to come over it seemed they were very busy gossiping at the counter
Food was so-so nothing special the salads good use cheese served very plain
Better restaurants nearby
I can't give this palce 5 stars because hell
its just not a 5 star place
But it's the Pickle!  If ever in Brecksville stop over at the neighborhood bar for cheap
quality food (you get what you pay for though)
a typical old bar atmosphere
free popcorn
and sit in chairs that I swear haven't changed since I was 5
The place is awesome
I'm there every weekend
Great prices
 Good food
Typical fare: burgers chicken
fish
etc  Really friendly and eccentric staff
This place is a keeper
 Try the hot pickle
I buy them and use them in bloody marys
Neighborhood bar
with the friendliness that comes with it
Also the quality of food you would expect
Family friendly
We came here for dinner to celebrate my friends Birthday
The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service is incredible but for some reason I felt like something was missing
The food was decent but way over priced
I guess for the money we paid I was expecting something else
Overall it was a nice evening and my friend had fun so thats all that matters right?Ah
Khotan
I knew you when (SIGH) you were something different
a perfect blend of Asia's decor and food
and how far you have fallen since that time
While I still appreciate your service and your stunning looks
I am surprised by what has happened to your menu
sorry looking sashimi (though the uni was a standout
shouts out to Santa Barbara!!)
uninspired hot foods (kung pao shrimp at $21? For real?? )
even the drinks are sorry in comparison to what once was
SIGH
Perhaps this is why you are closing your doors from November 30th through January 3rd (Seriously? During one of the busiest times of the year in Vegas!?) At least you still have your Treasure Island pirate show
which will always be a sight to behold
Perhaps you should visit what you once were (read: Social House at Crystals) and reclaim your glorious days
Until then
I will continue to hold onto hope that you will find your spotlight (or at least a better menu) once again
Khotan sucks as a place to eat
The girls and I went to this place for "Dinner" but really all we got was appetizers
We went during happy hour so it was suppose to be cheaper
but it don't mean the size is bigger
I ordered some spicy tuna and it was $7 for like a tiny portion that didn't do anything for me at all
The roll were so tiny it was about the size of a quarter and I got four of those
BOO times 2
The only reason this place got two stars out of me was the bartender
They both were entertaining and he gave us some drinks for free
Atmosphere is really not impressive either
My boyfriend and I decided to go resturant hunting on our visit in LV for our 1 year anniversary
we didnt have a spot in mind but on our many
many
many walks on the strip we found Khotan
So I decided to call and make a reservation since I didnt know whether it was a forsure spot we would get in for dinner
*WHICH I DO RECOMMEND
BTW!* We got there and were greeted and waited in the longue/bar area
it was def cute
we were soon taken to our seats in the patio area (which i also do recommend esp if you come around the 9 o' clock time frame for the pirates show
) OMG
when were going up there are beautiful gold deposit boxes all around then you hit the patio/seating area and you get a great view of the strip AND the pirate show
feels  like the fireworks are going to hit you haha
The food was great
me and my bf def recommend the chicken lollipops for a appetizer (get two bc i could finish that whole plate if i didnt have to share with my bf HAHAHA)
You def wont regret it
I ordered the Khotan Beef plate and it was actually good! I wish it did have a little more but I was full forsure
My boyfriend had the Orange chicken plate I believe and he enjoyed that plate as well although he did wish he had more food on there
just b/c hes def a fattie
haha
Overall
great place for some pan Asian food
GREAT SERVICE btw!
great views
free show of the pirate show w/o the bussling of the crowds
patio seating is great and def a great overall resturant in vegas
***for lounge only****
Maybe I like this place only because my friend and I stumbled upon this place during happy hour
Oh the two best words ever
We ordered from the cocktail happy hour and I got some cranberry concoction (don't remember the name) and my friend had the asian pear
I liked mine since it's tart as I like it but my friend didn't care for it
She did love her asian pear though since it was pretty sweet
We were going to have dinner so we didn't splurge on appetizers but the couple next to us took advantage of the happy hour prices
I took a peek and it looked like it was good since they ate every bite of their sushi rolls
Bartender was really nice as well
Noted
maybe on a weekend this place is poppin' but I enjoyed the quietness in the busy Vegas atmosphere on a Thursday night
I love the decor and vibe of Khotan
A little hard to find at first but once you enter
it's worth the search
I really liked the safe deposit boxes in the entryway - made for some cute pictures
Food: Yum! I think it *may* be hit or miss based on reading other reviews but we chose wisely
Here's what I liked:
Spicy tuna roll - just enough spice
quality fish
Curry noodles - love the curry they used
definitely singaporean
big shrimps
Ginger chicken with broccoli - a lighter option with clean flavors
Service: Great! Our sever recommended his favorite drinks and was helpful answering questions about the food
This would be a great date spot
I'll be back to enjoy the atmosphere :)Worst sushi rolls ever -- the shape and size of a box of Tic Tacs with chewy rice and a rectangular layer of raw fish on the top
Bland
difficult to eat
We were hoping it was the same chef as Social House (restaurant at what is now Khotan's spot) because there was a jalapeno yellowtail sashimi on the menu (like the amazing one we'd had at Social House two years ago)
The jalapeno yellowtail sashimi was actually excellent
The rest of the meal was totally downhill
When we started walking upstairs to get our table
the maitre 'd called out
"Watch your step because if you fall
I'd have to laugh at you
"
So
they can't make sushi and they have some clueless staffers too
Don't waste your time or if you insist on going
try the hot foods versus the sushi rolls
My girlfriend and I stayed at TI and we were looking for an easy dinner one night
so we decided to stroll into Khotan
Meh
I wouldn't say the food was bad
but it wasn't good
I think the best word to describe it would be: amateurish
It would be hard to believe that they had real sushi chefs in the kitchen
or that they used high quality fish
Some of the fish didn't taste like anything!  No taste!
The service was pretty good
but our waiter didn't seem to know much about fish
Don't waste your money on the Jalepeno Hamachi appetizer
I don't know how anyone could have the nerve to charge $22 for 5 tiny pieces low grade Hamachi (if it even was Hamachi) on a chip
The Tuna Tartare wasn't that great either
I've had better hors d'oeuvres at weddings
The concept of the Salmon Parmesan roll sounded good
but when eating it
the Parmesan didn't make sense
I was in the mood for noodles
so we also ordered the Crab Lo Mein
It was basically ramen noodles with a few pieces of tasteless crab on top
I could've made ramen noodles and topped it with imitation crab for about $2 and it would have been just as good
or better
than their $14 dish
I was extremely excited to visit this restuarant since I"d been planning my reservation there for weeks
thanks to a smart groupon buy
I have to say our seating was amazing out on the scenic deck
However
I do have to say
that the food was blah
I ordered the Salt and Pepper Prawns and the waiter expressed to me that they had a few shells underneath HOWEVER the Prawns came whole
fried with shells and eyes
I mentioned that I was expecting a few shells but couldn't eat through these
he said well
I told you that it came with shells and half-heartely offered to recook them
This only after the plate had been sitting for twenty minutes
He avoided our table like the plague as I could tell he could clearly see I was NOT eating
AT the end he offered a free dessert but by that time it was a little too late for me
I don't like to compare high end asian restaurant to PF CHANGs but on this night PF would win
Try The GRand Wok in the MGM grand
Only 4 stars because of the expense--without our $55 Groupon
our meal for two
including one large house sake
would have been over $100
However
even if we hadn't had the Groupon
it would have been WELL worth the money
What a find!! The decor is gorgeous
we were waited on by two attentive garcons (sat at the sushi bar so chatted with the sushi chefs as well)
and the menu is extremely creative and--most importantly--DELICIOUS
Our waiter recommended the yellowtail appetizer with tempura jalepenos in a light
yummy sauce and WOW was he right
We both "mm'd" through our whole meal
starting right from the tasty beginning
Every piece of sushi (we got the large maki for dinner so we received about 20 pieces of sushi) was fresh
generous and absolutely fantastic
By the time we finished our large dinner order we were almost full
but definitely not ready to stop eating! We each ordered another round of nigiri--my boyfriend got tuna and I got salmon
YUM!
What a hidden gem
thanks to Groupon for helping us find this one! We will DEFINITELY be returning next time we're in Vegas
Sushi was very average and very expensive with no wow factor
Tasted just "bleh"
Miso soup was very salty and ginger salad was made from a lot of weird lettuce that was not cut small and difficult to eat
Took a long time to get the salad
We asked to sit on the balcony to watch the show and they gave us a table at the backside so we couldn't see
Service was barely ok and kept making excuses why it was taking so long
A Superficial place in Treasure Island
trying too hard to be upscale
however
the food quality does not meet its price tag
which is way overly priced
Fast food quality
price higher than TAO
go figure
Staff also try too hard and gets annoying
No wonder their business is not good at all
TI is not an upscale place to visit either
I can't say from my experience that I understand the mediocre reviews for Khotan
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal
We didn't have the sushi and stuck to mainstream pekinese type dishes; lettuce wraps
edamame (ok
they're Japaneze)
lobster curry and sweet&sour chicken
all of which were fresh and tasty
I suspect this place may suffer from an expectations standpoint
It is not that expensive
we paid approaching twice the price at Jasmine two nights before for a similar quality meal
I am going to brutally honest here and suggest what is expensive to a TI guest is not the same to a Bellagio one ( we are neither by the way)
Give this place a try
We really liked it
Like several other reviewers
I went to Khotan because a friend had a Groupon and we of course waited until the last minute to use it
I checked out the menu before going and was really scared
It really looked like a Panda Express menu with such exotic choices as sweet and sour chicken
orange chicken
and beef and broccoli
Authentic
Khotan is not
But
hey
it's food and we had a coupon
The decor inside is really wonderful
with really interesting jade statues
ivory carvings
and a wall of gold
vault-like boxes
A++ for effort there
We were seated outside and it was  a nice night
But
seriously
that Sirens show is craptastic and if you're not a fan
sit inside
We ordered Khotan lobster
chicken lo mein
brown rice
and a tempura platter
The sauce in the Khotan lobster is great
but
gasp
it's $36
The chicken lo mein was "eh
" very boring and the chicken was slightly overcooked
The tempura platter was delicious but anything fried always is
I'm conflicted because I generally liked the execution
food
and service
but it was such a boring menu I'd probably never go back
If you want expensive Panda Express-esque food with a strip view
however
this is your place
We stumbled upon khotan by pure laziness
We were watching the TI show (wow
not kid friendly anymore) and gambled a little before we started getting some hunger pangs
So we wandered a little bit and saw the downstairs opening for this place
We thought it was a small casual place and had no idea it was considered upscale dining
The host greeted us then talked into his ear radio
He then escorted us to the elevator and sent us up
We were then greeted by another host and seated in the bar area since it was a quiet sunday night
We just needed a few bites to eat so we could make our flight without starving
Started off w
some edamame (the norm
nothing crazy) then we shared chicken lollipops (not bad)
kobe sliders (looked dry but were actually moist)
gai lan side dish (cant go wrong w/ veggies) and a noodle dish (don't remember which but it was dry dry dry and super chewy/tough rice noodles
terrible)
It was just a spot we ended up at due to convenience of it's location
